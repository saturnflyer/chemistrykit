- Pulled out the log value setter from shared_context and rolled this up into selenium-connect instead. Bumped to new version of selenium-connect to get this functionality
- Reworked the status check and exit logic order and implemented it as a ternary (effectively regressing back to what was there way back when). A better band-aid fix for now.
- added small tweak to catch the {} returned by calling ckit, which was giving an hash to integer conversion error
- Bumped version and removed the un-used spec dir

- Looks like my previous commit didn't include the cleanup of old files. Here you go! Also, updated the readme slightly
- Wired up selenium-connect and gladly gutted a heap of code that it replaced. Also, updated the readme and updated the gemspec.

- Case statement for symlinking, added notes about they whys
